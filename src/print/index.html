    <h5>After his 61th birthday, Jep Gambardella,
      <br>
      an aging intellectual and one-time writer,
      <br>
      decides to dedicate his life to the search
      <br>
      of a meaning.
      <br>
      On the background of a mysterious and
      <br>
      wonderful Rome,our main character slowly
      <br>
      rediscovers beauty under the monotonous,
      <br>
      empty shell of a lifetime between sinners.
      <br>
      Following a boring night spent between
      <br>
      the sheets of a boring and egocentric rich
      <br>
      woman from Milan, Jep decides to stick on
      <br>
      a quieter quality of life, but several, casual,
      <br>
      meetings will force him to reconsider his
      <br>
      priorities.
      <br>
      A stripper on the verge of breakdown,
      <br>
      the ex-husband of his first love, a bizarre
      <br>
      magician and a living Saint from a far away
      <br>
      reality, will soon allow Jep to discover
      <br>
      his own, personal, <i class="italique">Great Beauty.</i></h5>

    <h3>Travel is useful,
      it exercises the imagination.
      <br>
      All the rest
      is disappointment and fatigue.
      <br>
      Our journey is entirely imaginary.
      </br>
      That is its strength.
      It goes from life to death.
      </br>
      People, animals, cities, things,
      all are imagined.
      </br>
      It’s a novel,
      just a fictitious narrative.
      And besides,
      </br>
      anyone can do as much. You just have
      </br>
      to close your eyes. It’s on the other side of life.
      <br>

        <p class="right"> Get lost!
          What the hell are you doing?
          My phone’s been stolen!
          I’m starring in two TV dramas...
          I’m playing a Pope in one,
          and a junkie on the road to recovery
          in the other.</p>
        <p class="left">Impressive!
          No theatre work?
          I’m supposed to do
          Shakespeare with Pietro, but...
          it has to be at least
          three hours long,
          be an ambitious project,
          and no more small cities!
          I’m trying to write a piece
          for theatre, and the concept is...</p>
        <p class="right"> What about you?</p>
        <p class="left">I might give up acting.</p>
        <p class="right">In this shitty country there are
          never any good female roles.
          I’ll write my first novel,
          a Proust-style piece.</p>
        <p class="left">Really?
          Proust is my favourite writer!
          Along with Ammaniti...</p>

          Don’t you recognise her?</p>
        <p class="right">It’s Lorena.</p>
        <p class="left">Who?</p>
        <p class="right">An ex TV showgirl, now in
          full physical and mental decline.</p>
        <p class="left">Never seen her! But then
          I’ve never had a television.
          Viola, I know you don’t have one.
          You tell me all the time.</p>
        <p class="right"> What does she do now?</p>

          the smell of old
          people’s houses.
          The question was:

          Then I should crash on your sofa...
          Go home, I need to pack
          and I don’t want anyone around.</p>
        <p class="left">But I live miles away.</p>

          Run along!
          <br>
          Catellani?<br>
          The best, of course.
          Did Catellani the tailor
          make your suit?
          There was no doubt
          about Malagna’s shady intentions.
          The girl should be rescued
          at any cost, without loss of time.
          Sir, you drank!
          Just enough to forget
          my birthday.</p>
        <p class="right">You want infusion?</p>
        <p class="left">Heavens, no!</p>
        <p class="right">I got you a present.</p>
        <p class="left">How sweet!
          This is a lucky charm
          from my country.
          Good thing it’s lucky,
          because it’s pretty ugly.
          Keep it on your bedside
          and stop complaining!
          <p class="right">I will! And thanks.
            Wake me up at 15:00, you rascal.</p>
          <p class="left">You’re funny when you call me that!</p>
          <p class="right">I don’t love you!</p>
          <p class="left">Brilliant!</p>
          <p class="right">Did you enjoy the performance?</p>
          <p class="left">Parts of it.
            That violent head-butt
            made me understand many things.</p>
          <p class="right">Let’s start from the beginning.</p>
          <p class="left">Or the end?
            You know, Talia Concept
            loves to provoke.
            Don’t bother, there are more
            important things than provoking me.
            And this habit of speaking
            in the third person is unbearable.
            What are you reading?
            <p class="right">I don’t need to read, I live
              on vibrations, extra-sensory ones.
              Extra-sensoriality aside.</p>
            <p class="left">What do you mean by vibrations?</p>
            <p class="right">The poetry of vibrations cannot
              be described
              with the vulgarity of words.</p>
            <p class="left">Well, try at least.</p>
            <p class="right">I’m an artist,
              I don’t need to explain jack shit.
              So I’ll write: «Lives on vibrations,
              but she doesn’t know what they are.»
              I’m starting to dislike
              this interview.</p>
            <p class="left">I sense conflictuality in you.</p>
            <p class="right">Conflictuality as a vibration?</p>
            <p class="left">As a pain in the ass.
              Let’s talk about my mom’s
              abusive boyfriend.
              <p class="right"> No! I want to know
                what a vibration is.
                It’s my radar to intercept
                the world.</p>
              <p class="left">Your radar... meaning?</p>
              <p class="right">You’re a pain in the ass.
                We got off to a bad start...
                Talia Concept wants to be
                interviewed by your paper,
                it has many readers.
                But you’re biased.</p>

                                I read your book as a teenager,
                                I’ve never forgotten the end.

                                  more or less.

                                    almost without realizing it,
                                    into what might be defined
                                    as the whirlpool of the high life.
                                    But I didn’t just want to live
                                    the high life.

                                      Forgive me.
                                      She could too.
                                      Elisa died.
                                      Yesterday.</p>

                                      Don’t leave me.
                                      We were married for 35 years...
                                      but Elisa always loved you.</p>
                                    <p class="left">What are you saying?
                                      Elisa and I went out together
                                      when we were kids.
                                      She left me, I think,
                                      it was so long ago I don’t remember.</p>
                                    <p class="right">Yes, she left you.
                                      On September 8th, 1970.
                                      Exactly...
                                      You’re distraught now,
                                      that’s normal.
                                      I’m not distraught.
                                      Elisa only ever loved one man.
                                      <br>
                                      You.</p>
                                    <p class="left">How can you say that?
                                      I never saw Elisa again,
                                      you were together for a lifetime!</p>
                                    <p class="right">I found a diary of hers,
                                      with a lock.
                                      And I broke the lock off.</p>
                                    <p class="left">I write for a living, believe me...
                                      when you write, you give life

                                      I was only a good companion.
                                      That’s all she wrote about me.
                                      35 years together...
                                      and I’m mentioned in two lines
                                      as a good companion.
                                      Here, Alfredo.
                                      What’ll you do now?</p>

                                      I’ll live in adoration of her.</p>

                                    <p class="left">Please, I’m a gentleman.
                                      Don’t destroy my only certainty.</p>
                                    <p class="right">Tell me exactly what my lies are
                                      and what my fragility is!
                                      I’m a woman with balls, tell me!</p>
                                    <p class="left">«Woman with balls» would be too much
                                      for any gentleman.
                                      All right, Stefania,
                                      you asked for it. In random order:
                                      Your civil vocation during
                                      your student days went unnoticed.
                                      But another vocation of yours
                                      is remembered by many,
                                      the one practiced by you then,
                                      in the university toilets.</p>
                                    <p class="right">You wrote about the Party because
                                      you were its leader’s mistress.
                                      And your 11 novels,
                                      published by a small publishing
                                      house subsidized by the Party,
                                      reviewed by minor Party-affiliated
                                      newspapers,
                                      are insignificant,
                                      everyone says so.</p>
                                    <p class="left">I’m not saying my novelette
                                      was any better,
                                      I agree with you there.
                                      Your relationship with Eusebio...
                                      What relationship? Eusebio
                                      loves Giordano, everyone knows.
                                      He has for years.</p>
                                    <p class="right">They lunch every day
                                      at Arnaldo’s, under the coat rack,
                                      like sweethearts under an oak tree.</p>
                                    <p class="left">You all know but turn a blind eye.
                                      Your dedication to your children,
                                      with all the sacrifices entailed...
                                      You work all week in TV,
                                      you go out every night,
                                      even on Mondays, when popper
                                      dealers don’t even venture out.
                                      You’re never with your children,
                                      not even on the
                                      long holidays you take.
                                      And plus you have a butler,
                                      a waiter,
                                      a cook, a chauffeur
                                      who drives the kids to school,
                                      three babysitters, so...
                                      how and when exactly
                                      do you make any sacrifices?</p>
                                    <p class="right">These are the untruths and fragility
                                      I’m talking about.
                                      Stefania, mother and woman.
                                      You’re 53, with a life in tatters,
                                      like the rest of us.
                                      Instead of acting superior
                                      and treating us with contempt,
                                      you should look at us
                                      with affection.</p>
                                    <p class="left">We’re all on the brink of despair,
                                      all we can do
                                      is look each other in the face,
                                      keep each other company,
                                      joke a little...
                                      Don’t you agree?
                                      Son of a bitch!
                                      Egidio, old chap!
                                      Bastard!
                                      I haven’t seen you in 30 years!</p>
                                    <p class="right">I need to talk to you.</p>
                                    <p class="left">Later! I’m busy, can’t you see?</p>
                                    <p class="right">Is this still your place?</p>
                                    <p class="left">Luckily not, I sold it.
                                      I’m still the manager though.
                                      You’re famous! You’re always
                                      in the gossip rags.
                                      You’re at all the VIP parties,
                                      always with a girl!
                                      You never come here...
                                      Get lost, will you?
                                      We’re having a serious talk!</p>
                                    <p class="right">Are you married?</p>
                                    <p class="left">Married, divorced.</p>
                                    <p class="right">I’ve got a daughter, Ramona.</p>
                                    <p class="left">Did you have to call her Ramona?</p>
                                    <p class="right">You artists are all the same!
                                      I tell you I have a daughter
                                      and you complain about her name!</p>
                                    <p class="left">What’s wrong with «Ramona»?</p>
                                    <p class="right">Nothing, it’s a name that implies
                                      ambitions...</p>
                                    <p class="left">There’s my daughter, you see?
                                      She makes me so mad,
                                      I’ve told her a million times!
                                      You’re too old for this!
                                      Now these hot young Polish girls
                                      rule the scene.</p>
                                    <p class="right">They’re experts at turning tricks.
                                      She’s 42 and she wants to be
                                      a sophisticated stripper.
                                      But the world’s no longer
                                      sophisticated. Right, Jep?</p>
                                    <p class="left">I know, only you and I are.
                                      That’s right, goddammit!
                                      But she wants to keep doing
                                      this job, for the money.</p>
                                    <p class="right">I don’t know why
                                      she always needs money
                                      and what she fucking
                                      does with it.</p>
                                    <p class="left">For drugs? - I wish,
                                      we’d have a common interest.
                                      She doesn’t even drink beer.
                                      I don’t know what she spends
                                      her money on, she’s always broke.</p>
                                    <p class="right">Do I seem like a loser?</p>
                                    <p class="left">No, why?</p>
                                    <img class="img-print O" src="img/18.jpg" />
                                    <p class="right1">Because I can hear myself talk,
                                      I sound like a loser.
                                      I’m nearly 70 and I have to work
                                      till 6 in the morning every day.
                                      I swapped cocaine for heroin
                                      15 years ago.
                                      What an asshole!
                                      A heroin junkie at 50!
                                      Could I be more of a loser?
                                      But I’m not important,
                                      it’s her I worry about, I love her.
                                      And I’m no loser there,
                                      I’m a father.
                                      And like all fathers, I’m worried.
                                      What’ll she do in a few years?
                                      She can’t be a stripper at 50!</p>
                                    <p class="left">Why don’t you fix her up?</p>
                                    <p class="right">Me?
                                      Don’t you know any rich guys
                                      who want a beautiful wife?
                                      We could change her name,
                                      that’s no problem.
                                      You’d do me a big favour.</p>
                                    <p class="left">I’m a writer, not a pimp.</p>
                                    <p class="right">Sorry, I was a bit vulgar.
                                      Daddy’s little girl, this is
                                      my good friend, Jep Gambardella.
                                      I’ll leave you to it,
                                      I need the toilet.
                                      Be right back!</p>
                                    <p class="left">Hi, I’m Jep.</p>
                                    <p class="right">Ramona.</p>

                                    <p class="right">Are you kidding?
                                      Who wants a girl?
                                      Not me.
                                      I really am an old friend
                                      of your father’s.</p>
                                    <p class="left">Dad has no friends.</p>
                                    <p class="right">He used to.</p>

                                      my friends to leave to come here.
                                      Your father was a nice guy.
                                      He taught me loads of things,
                                      such as: vodka is uncouth.</p>
                                    <p class="right">How useful!</p>
                                    <p class="left">He asked me to find you a husband.
                                      He’s obsessed.</p>
                                    <p class="right">I’m not looking for a husband.
                                      Well, you should be.</p>

                                      I’ll have burlesque dancers there.
                                      Of course.

                                            I see her at yoga twice a week.</p>
                                          <p class="right">You’ll come?</p>
                                          <p class="left">Of course.</p>
                                          <p class="right">See you Thursday.</p>
                                          <p class="left">Okay.
                                            Goodbye.</p>
                                          <p class="right">Watch that table carefully, but
                                            don’t let them notice you looking.
                                            Waiter? Champagne, please.</p>
                                          <p class="left">Cristal.
                                            You can’t imagine
                                            how much one learns
                                            by living alongside
                                            a cluster of religious institutes.
                                            So that was your first time?</p>
                                          <p class="right">Yes, he didn’t think he’d been good,
                                            too quick, he said.
                                            So, out of anger or to let off
                                            steam, I’m not sure which,
                                            he got a football
                                            and played with it furiously!
                                            And you?</p>
                                          <p class="left">I didn’t enjoy making love with him,
                                            but seeing him with a football
                                            was an unforgettable thing!</p>
                                          <p class="right">He became really good,
                                            he played on the national team.
                                            Your dad said you spend everything
                                            you earn.
                                            What on? You can tell me.</p>
                                          <p class="left">Maybe one day. But why didn’t you
                                            write another book?</p>
                                          <p class="right">Because I went out too much
                                            at night.
                                            Rome makes you waste a lot of time.
                                            It’s distracting.
                                            Writing requires focus and peace.
                                            That’s not much of an answer.
                                            You have plenty of peace here,
                                            it’s like being in the country.</p>
                                          <p class="left">I wrote in short spurts.
                                            I was a sprint-style writer.
                                            I told you about my first time...
                                            but you’ve told me nothing.
                                            It’s your turn now.</p>
                                          <p class="right">On an island... one summer.
                                            I was...
                                            18, she was 20.
                                            At the lighthouse, at night.
                                            I went to kiss her,
                                            she turned away.
                                            I was disappointed.
                                            But then she turned to look at me.
                                            She brushed me with her lips...
                                            she smelled of flowers.
                                            I didn’t move,
                                            I wasn’t able to move.
                                            Then she took a step back...
                                            and said...
                                            She took a step back.
                                            And said...
                                            I’m going home, it’s late.
                                            Want to come to a party
                                            tomorrow night?</p>
                                          <p class="left">Outstanding!
                                            Did you want us to die tonight?
                                            You won’t believe it,
                                            but I love knife throwers.

                                            It’ll look great on the mantelpiece.

                                            Are you stupid?
                                            You’re distracting my artist.

                                        but it’s tiny.</p>
                                      <p class="left">Stay still, I’ll take a photo of you.
                                        Don’t move.
                                        That’s no good.
                                        Laugh.
                                        Got it?
                                        Yes, that’s good.</p>
                                      <p class="right">Many think that a funeral,
                                        is a fortuitous event,
                                        without any rules.</p>
                                      <p class="left">That’s not true.
                                        A funeral is a high-society event
                                        par excellence.
                                        You must never forget
                                        that at a funeral
                                        you are appearing on stage.</p>
                                      <p class="right">Nice.</p>
                                      <p class="left">Nice, but try the other one.
                                        You must patiently wait
                                        for the relatives to disperse.
                                        Once you are sure
                                        that all the guests are seated...
                                        only at that point, may you offer
                                        your condolences to the family.</p>
                                      <p class="right">In this way, everyone will see you.
                                        You take the mourner’s hands,
                                        and rest yours on their arms.
                                        You whisper something to them,
                                        a comforting phrase,
                                        said with authority.
                                        For example:
                                        «In the days to come,
                                        when you feel the void,
                                        I want you to know
                                        that you can always count on me.»</p>
                                      <p class="left">The public will ask...
                                        «What’s Jep Gambardella saying?»</p>
                                      <p class="right">This is definitely the right dress.
                                        You’re allowed to retire
                                        to a corner by yourself,
                                        as if contemplating your sorrow.
                                        However, another matter
                                        must be approached with shrewdness.</p>
                                      <p class="left">The chosen place needs
                                        to be isolated
                                        but clearly visible
                                        to the public.</p>
                                      <p class="right">Besides, a performance is good when
                                        it is devoid of any superfluity.
                                        So, the fundamental rule:
                                        one must never cry at a funeral.</p>

                                      <p class="left">You must never steal the show
                                        from the family’s sorrow.
                                        That is forbidden.
                                        Because it is immoral.
                                        Viola.</p>
                                      <p class="right">In the days to come,
                                        when you feel the void,
                                        you can always count on me.</p>
                                      <p class="left">Now I ask Andrea’s friends
                                        to come forward,
                                        so that the coffin
                                        may be carried outside.</p>
                                      <p class="right">Your back!</p>
                                      <p class="left">It was nice not making love.
                                        It was nice loving each other.
                                        I’d forgotten what loving someone
                                        was about, I’d forgotten that.
                                        I spend all my money to cure myself.</p>
                                      <p class="right">Your breakfast.</p>
                                      <p class="left">Come on, I’m taking you to see
                                        a sea monster today.</p>
                                      <p class="right">Your breakfast.</p>
                                      <p class="left">Five more minutes.</p>
                                      <p class="right">Can you see the sea?</p>
                                      <p class="left">Where?</p>
                                      <p class="right">On the ceiling.</p>
                                      <p class="left">Yes, I can see it.</p>
                                      <p class="right"> Who’s going to look after you now?</p>
                                      <p class="left">I’m sorry about your daughter.
                                        My condolences.</p>
                                      <p class="right">I spent all my summers
                                        making plans for September.
                                        Not any longer.
                                        Now I spend the summer
                                        remembering the good intentions
                                        which vanished.
                                        In part because of laziness,
                                        in part because of carelessness.</p>
                                      <p class="left"> What’s wrong
                                        with feeling nostalgic?</p>
                                      <p class="right">It’s the only distraction left
                                        for those
                                        who’ve no faith
                                        in the future!
                                        Without rain...
                                        August is coming to an end
                                        and September isn’t arriving.
                                        And I’m so ordinary!</p>
                                      <p class="left">But there’s no need to worry.
                                        It’s all right, it’s okay.</p>
                                      <p class="right">Bravo!
                                        Thank you.
                                        What are you doing here?
                                        Arturo!
                                        Why are you here?</p>
                                      <p class="left">Don’t you see?
                                        I’m rehearsing my magic show.
                                        This is tomorrow’s special number:
                                        the vanishing giraffe.</p>
                                      <p class="right">You can make this giraffe vanish?</p>
                                      <p class="left">Of course I can make
                                        the giraffe vanish!
                                        Then make me vanish too.
                                        Jep, do you think that if I could
                                        really make people vanish
                                        I’d still be here at my age
                                        playing these circus games?</p>
                                      <p class="right">It’s just a trick.
                                        It’s just a trick!
                                        Romano, how did it go?
                                        Well, they clapped.
                                        I’m glad.</p>
                                      <p class="left">So why are you so sad?</p>
                                      <p class="right">I’m not sad.</p>
                                      <p class="left">What’s with the giraffe?</p>
                                      <p class="right">For a magic show.</p>
                                      <p class="left">I’ll come and see you tomorrow.</p>
                                      <p class="right">I’m not doing the show tomorrow.</p>
                                      <p class="left">Why not? You said it went well.</p>
                                      <p class="right">I’m leaving, I’m going back
                                        to my home town, for good.
                                        I won’t even pack up my things,
                                        I’ll leave it all.
                                        I’ve lived in this city
                                        for 40 years.
                                        And in the end I thought...
                                        the only person
                                        who deserved a goodbye
                                        was you.</p>
                                      <p class="left">So you’re leaving?</p>
                                      <p class="right">Romano... why are you leaving?</p>
                                      <p class="left">Rome has really disappointed me.</p>
                                      <p class="right">Bye, Jep.</p>
                                      <p class="left">See?</p>
                                      <p class="right">Want some coffee?</p>
                                      <p class="left">No, thanks. I know you’re busy.
                                        I need to ask you something.</p>
                                      <p class="right">Go ahead.</p>
                                      <p class="left">Why did Elisa leave me?</p>

                                      <p class="left">Didn’t she say anything about it
                                        in her diary?</p>
                                      <p class="right">No, I don’t think so.</p>
                                      <p class="left">Would you be offended
                                        if I asked to read it?</p>
                                      <p class="right">No, I wouldn’t.
                                        In fact, I’d understand.
                                        But I’m afraid I can’t
                                        let you read it.</p>
                                      <p class="left">Why not?</p>
                                      <p class="right">Because a few days after the
                                        funeral, I threw it away.
                                        May I introduce you
                                        to my girlfriend?</p>
                                      <p class="left">Hello, my name’s Polina.
                                        Like Polina in «The Gambler»
                                        by Dostoyevsky.</p>
                                      <p class="right">What are you doing tonight?</p>
                                      <p class="left">Nothing.</p>
                                      <p class="right">Polina’s going to finish ironing...
                                        then we’ll drink a glass
                                        of red wine.</p>
                                      <p class="left">We’ll watch some television
                                        and go to bed.</p>
                                      <p class="right">What about you?</p>
                                      <p class="left">I’ll have a lot of drinks, but not
                                        so many as to become unruly.
                                        And then...
                                        when you’ll be getting up
                                        I’ll be going to bed.</p>
                                      <p class="right">What lovely people you are!
                                        I love doing the train!</p>
                                      <p class="left">I’ll screw you.
                                        «Who am I?»
                                        That’s how
                                        one of Breton’s novels began.
                                        And of course in the book
                                        there’s no reply.</p>
                                      <p class="right"> Did you hear about Viola?</p>
                                      <p class="left">What?
                                        She’s donating everything
                                        to the church.
                                        She works in the parish
                                        and is going to volunteer in Africa.
                                        The trains at our parties
                                        are the best ones in Rome!</p>
                                      <p class="right">You think so?</p>
                                      <p class="left">I do.
                                        They’re the best because
                                        they go nowhere.</p>
                                      <p class="right">Well?</p>
                                      <p class="left">It’s wonderful, thank you.</p>
                                      <p class="right">Come on, it’s all gone.</p>
                                      <p class="left">Tell me why you left me, please.</p>
                                      <p class="right"> I want an explanation, please!</p>
                                      <p class="left">Go away!</p>
                                      <p class="right">Get out! Get out!</p>
                                      <p class="left">You see all these people?
                                        They can’t do anything.
                                        But I know how to do something.</p>
                                      <p class="right">We know how to do something.</p>
                                      <p class="left">How sweet!
                                        They’ve been asking me for years
                                        why I don’t write another novel.
                                        But look at these people.
                                        This Wildlife!
                                        This is my life
                                        and it’s nothing.
                                        Flaubert wanted to write a book
                                        about nothing but he failed,
                                        so could I do it?</p>
                                      <p class="right">It’s nice.</p>
                                      <p class="left">Thanks, rascal.</p>
                                      <p class="right">What inspired this exhibition?</p>
                                      <p class="left">It wasn’t my idea
                                        to do this photo exhibition.
                                        It was my father’s idea.
                                        When I was born, he starting taking
                                        photos of me, every day.
                                        One photo per day.
                                        He never forgot, not even once.
                                        From the age of 14 upwards,
                                        I continued.
                                        I photographed myself every day.
                                        Go ahead.</p>
                                      <p class="right">Cardinal!</p>
                                      <p class="left">Your Eminence!
                                        Cardinal,
                                        when will The Saint arrive in Rome?
                                        On Thursday,
                                        but please don’t call her The Saint.
                                        She is a Saint but not technically.
                                        Tell me something,
                                        who is that cardinal?</p>
                                      <p class="right">That’s Bellucci.</p>
                                      <p class="left">Bellucci?</p>
                                      <p class="right">The one in line to be...</p>
                                      <p class="left">Exactly.
                                        The papal throne awaits him.
                                        I met him at Giada Ricci’s
                                        carnival party.
                                        Rumour has it that he used to be
                                        Europe’s best exorcist.</p>
                                      <p class="right">Are you pulling my leg?</p>
                                      <p class="left">No.
                                        I never joke about the devil.
                                        Do you know I’m very, very bored.
                                        We’re having a great, great time.
                                        You cut up the duck.
                                        Cook it on a high flame
                                        for 15 minutes.
                                        At that point...
                                        Cardinal, do you remember me?</p>
                                      <p class="right">Lello Cava.
                                        We met at Giada Ricci’s party.
                                        I was dressed as an escort.
                                        Come, they’re starting
                                        to serve lunch.
                                        I’d like you meet my writer friend,
                                        Jep Gambardella.
                                        A writer!
                                        This country needs writers.
                                        Actually I thought it was more
                                        in need of priests.
                                        Help.</p>
                                      <p class="left">May I ask you a question?</p>
                                      <p class="right">Of course, my dear man.
                                        Well, for some time now...
                                        from a spiritual point of view...</p>
                                      <p class="left">Skunk hunt?</p>
                                      <p class="right">Of course, I’ll lead the way!
                                        I know the Tebaldi grounds well.
                                        Jep Gambardella, the king
                                        of socialites! You’re losing it.
                                        I’ve been losing it for 40 years.
                                        It’s a steady decline.
                                        Tell me something, Stefania.
                                        Have we ever slept with each other?</p>
                                      <p class="left">Of course not!</p>
                                      <p class="right">That’s an awfully big mistake!
                                        We must make amends, immediately.</p>
                                      <p class="left">Idiot.</p>
                                      <p class="right">Thank goodness.
                                        We still have something nice
                                        to do together.</p>
                                      <p class="left">The future is marvelous, Stefania.</p>
                                      <p class="right">To be honest, Catellani
                                        hasn’t had many brushed fabrics
                                        in recent years.</p>
                                      <p class="left">In my opinion, Rebecchi’s still
                                        the best tailor in Rome.</p>
                                      <p class="right">Who are you?</p>
                                      <p class="left">A hard-working man.
                                        One who, while you play the artist
                                        and have fun with your friends,
                                        keeps this country going.</p>
                                      <p class="right">I keep this country going,
                                        but many people
                                        haven’t understood that yet.
                                        Imagine that, Dadina,
                                        Giulio Moneta was my neighbour.
                                        One of the world’s 10 most wanted
                                        men and I never noticed.</p>
                                      <p class="left">You’ve changed,
                                        you’re always thinking.</p>
                                      <p class="right">Maybe I should do what Romano did.
                                        I’m not fit for this life
                                        or this city.
                                        Nobody’s fit for shit, dammit.
                                        Take it from the queen of misfits.
                                        Everything around me is dying.
                                        People who are younger than me,
                                        things...
                                        All before my eyes and I...
                                        And you’re suffering.
                                        And you don’t understand.</p>
                                      <p class="left">How’s the soup, Little Jep?</p>
                                      <p class="right">The soup’s good.
                                        Why did you call me Little Jep? No
                                        one’s called me that for centuries.</p>
                                      <p class="left">Because a friend,
                                        every now and again,
                                        needs to make their friend
                                        feel like they did as a child.</p>
                                      <p class="right">How can I make you feel
                                        like a little girl?</p>
                                      <p class="left">You don’t need to, I feel
                                        like a little girl every day!
                                        I’ve seen the world from
                                        their viewpoint for 60 years.
                                        You know Sister Maria,
                                        the missionary,
                                        the one they call the Saint?
                                        Yes, she’s coming to Rome
                                        to receive some honour.
                                        Exactly. In all her life,
                                        she’s only given three interviews.</p>
                                      <p class="right">Yours will be memorable.</p>
                                      <p class="left">Yeah sure, think of Giulio Moneta!
                                        This is different.
                                        She studied in Italy
                                        and speaks Italian.
                                        She read your book and loved it.
                                        She wants to meet you
                                        so I organized a dinner party
                                        at your house tomorrow.</p>
                                      <p class="right">Did I do well?</p>
                                      <p class="left">You did very well.
                                        Tomorrow I’ll have the honour
                                        of dining with her.</p>
                                      <p class="right">At the Holy Father’s?</p>
                                      <p class="left">No.</p>
                                      <p class="right">No, at Jep Gambardella’s.
                                        You see, the Pope even invited
                                        the enclosed nuns.</p>
                                      <p class="left">Sisters, sisters, sisters!</p>
                                      <p class="right">Sisters, sisters...</p>
                                      <p class="left">Yes, perfect!</p>
                                      <p class="right">Ah, the Red Cross nurses!
                                        Well-toned!
                                        Okay, great...
                                        What handsome young men!
                                        Great!
                                        Let’s go!
                                        The Saint’s assistant called me.
                                        The Saint would like Count and
                                        Countess Odescalchi to come too,
                                        as they treated her like a sister
                                        when she lived in Italy.</p>
                                      <p class="left">Do you know them?</p>
                                      <p class="right">Of course,
                                        but they are not in Rome.
                                        All the nobles are in London,
                                        at Philip’s great-niece’s wedding.
                                        Let’s call the Colonnas of Reggio.
                                        The nobles for hire?
                                        They’re dead.
                                        Nonsense, they’re immortal.
                                        The Saint won’t even notice,
                                        70 years have gone by!
                                        This piece of furniture
                                        looks great...</p>
                                      <p class="left">Who would’ve thought!</p>
                                      <p class="right">It looks great, like a new bathroom!
                                        Count Colonna speaking.
                                        Yes, we are available.
                                        For tonight.
                                        Our rate is 250 euros per person
                                        for the evening.
                                        Plus the cost of the car hire.</p>
                                      <p class="left">This would be somewhat
                                        humiliating for us...
                                        We are willing to be hired
                                        as the Colonnas of Reggio.
                                        But as for pretending to be
                                        the Odescalchis...
                                        I don’t know...
                                        We were at war for two centuries.
                                        I feel it’s immoral.
                                        Cut at least twelve pieces
                                        of rabbit!
                                        Set aside the kidneys, liver,
                                        head.
                                        Gently brown.
                                        Don’t forget thyme,
                                        laurel leaves, rosemary...
                                        Then red wine, Ligurian olives...
                                        pine nuts.
                                        And after an hour,
                                        you have Ligurian-style rabbit!</p>
                                      <p class="right">Sister Maria, what convent
                                        are you staying at?</p>
                                      <p class="left">Actually, we’re at the Hassler Hotel
                                        at the Spanish Steps.
                                        To be honest, Sister Maria
                                        finds it uncomfortable.
                                        Never heard the Hassler
                                        described as uncomfortable!
                                        It’s very comfortable
                                        but Sister Maria isn’t used
                                        to sleeping in a bed.
                                        She sleeps on the floor,
                                        in a cardboard bed.
                                        Do you have any visits planned?
                                        Sister Maria will climb
                                        St John’s Basilica’s Scala Sancta
                                        on her knees.</p>
                                      <p class="right">Have you?</p>
                                      <p class="left">I’d have liked to, but...
                                        I have a bad knee...
                                        Orthopedic problems
                                        are unimportant,
                                        compared to the partial indulgence
                                        granted by the Scala Sancta.
                                        That’s true! Another specialty
                                        of mine is lamb with...</p>
                                      <p class="right">Does Sister Maria still help
                                        the sick?</p>
                                      <p class="left">22 hours a day, every day.
                                        She washes them, feeds them...
                                        You ought to see her.
                                        Despite her age,
                                        she doesn’t walk, she runs.
                                        Now she’s tired, but that’s because
                                        she’s not with her patients.
                                        How old is she?</p>
                                      <p class="right">She’ll be 104 in October.</p>
                                      <p class="left">That’s impressive.</p>
                                      <p class="right">I thought she was older!
                                        Longevity too, like all things,
                                        is not accidental.
                                        About Sister Maria’s interview
                                        with Jep...</p>
                                      <p class="left">Her interview?
                                        There must be a mix-up...
                                        Sister Maria hasn’t given
                                        any interviews since 1971,
                                        after the reason
                                        for her mission in Chad,
                                        was misunderstood by some.
                                        <p class="right">Of course, but considering
                                          her admiration for Jep’s work...</p>
                                        <p class="left">You told me she enjoyed
                                          «The Human Apparatus».</p>
                                        <p class="right">She found it beautiful and fierce.
                                          Like the world of men.</p>
                                        <p class="left">Great! There would be no risk
                                          of any misunderstanding,
                                          Sister Maria can review the text...</p>
                                        <p class="right">No, I’m sorry.
                                          <p class="left">Don’t insist.
                                            I don’t wish to raise
                                            any false hopes,
                                            there’s absolutely
                                            no question of any interview.
                                            Sorry, but why do
                                            you always answer?
                                            Why not let Sister Maria talk?
                                            Madam...
                                            I took a vow of poverty.
                                            And you can’t talk about poverty...
                                            you have to live it.
                                            Such true and real words!
                                            Powerful words!
                                            Do you need anything, madam?</p>
                                          <p class="right">She needs the bathroom.</p>
                                          <p class="left">It’s on the left.
                                            The change of diet
                                            isn’t good for her.
                                            Sister Maria, in Mali, only eats
                                            40 grams of plant roots a day.
                                            Me too sometimes, in the evening,
                                            as a light meal,
                                            <p class="right">I have some splendid
                                              roots with lemon.</p>
                                            <img class="img-print M" src="img/14.jpg" />
                                            <p class="left1">You clean the roots
                                              by scraping them with a knife
                                              and you cut them into small
                                              chunks.</p>
                                            <p class="right">Cardinal, remember when we met
                                              at that wedding?
                                              You were there too...
                                              I felt the need to ask you
                                              about matters close to my heart.</p>
                                            <p class="left">Matters regarding faith...
                                              regarding the strength
                                              of spirituality...
                                              But then you got distracted.
                                              You can ask me now.</p>
                                            <p class="right">No, I don’t see the point.</p>
                                            <p class="left">Why?
                                              I’d be very disappointed to discover
                                              that you have no answers.
                                              I’m only saying
                                              it’s a possibility...
                                              I think that...
                                              Never mind...
                                              I apologize for earlier.
                                              There is one question
                                              I really want to ask you.
                                              Are the rumors about you true?
                                              That you were a truly great...
                                              exorcist?
                                              Sister Maria...
                                              Sister Maria!</p>
                                            <p class="right">Sister Maria!</p>
                                            <p class="left">Saint...</p>
                                            <p class="right">Have you seen her?</p>
                                            <p class="left">No, she’s not there.</p>
                                            <p class="right">Sister Maria!</p>
                                            <p class="left">Saint...</p>
                                            <p class="right">Sister Maria!</p>
                                            <p class="left">Saint!</p>
                                            <p class="right">She’s called Sister Maria.</p>
                                            <p class="left">Sister Maria...
                                              Where has that bitch got to?
                                              Sister Maria!
                                              Sister Maria!
                                              My goodness!
                                              My goodness!</p>
                                            <p class="right">Come, Elisabetta, let’s go to bed.</p>
                                            <p class="left">You go ahead, I’m going upstairs
                                              for a moment.</p>
                                            <p class="right">Don’t be late.
                                              In this room, in 1930,
                                              Princess Antonietta gave birth
                                              to her only daughter,
                                              Elisabetta Colonna of Reggio.
                                              The princess died
                                              after giving birth.
                                              Young Elisabetta,
                                              in these opulent rooms,
                                              had a happy and carefree
                                              childhood.
                                              But shortly after, the financial
                                              hardship endured by Prince Erminio,
                                              forced him to sell the property.
                                              They’re migrating west...
                                              but now they are resting.
                                              Did you know
                                              that I know the Christian names...
                                              of all of these birds?</p>
                                            <p class="left">Why...
                                              did you never write another book?</p>
                                            <p class="right">I was looking for the great beauty,
                                              but...
                                              I didn’t find it.</p>
                                            <p class="left">Do you know...
                                              Why...
                                              I only eat roots?</p>
                                            <p class="right">No, why?
                                              Because roots are important.
                                              Now there’s something
                                              I want to show you.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p class="left1">This is how it always ends.
      With death.
      But first there was life.
      Hidden beneath the blah, blah, blah.
      It is all settled beneath
      the chitter chatter and the noise.
      Silence and sentiment.
      Emotion and fear.
      The haggard, inconstant
      flashes of beauty.
      And then the wretched squalor
      and miserable humanity.
      All buried under the cover of the
      embarrassment of being in the world.
      Beyond there is what lies beyond.
      I don’t deal
      with what lies beyond.
      Therefore...
      let this novel begin.
      After all... it’s just a trick.
      Yes, it’s just a trick.</p>
